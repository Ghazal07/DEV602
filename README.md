EXERCISE 1 – HELLO WORLD
Objective

In this first exercise, we will connect to the remote system, start the necessary services, and then create an application router to serve as the application endpoint and proxy all of our services and static HTML content. At the end of this exercise you will be able to connect to your HANA XS server via web browser and see a Hello World message.

EXERCISE 2 –DATABASE ARTIFACT DEVELOPMENT
Objective

In this exercise, we will continue to develop our application. We will data database table and stored procedure definitions to our applications. We will see how we use a node.js application to deploy these database artifacts using the new container-based, schema-less HDI (HANA Deployment Infrastructure) concepts. 

Exercise Description 

1. Database Tables via HDBCDS
2. Stored Procedures via HDBPROCEDURE
3. Initial table data load via CSV
4. Deploy to HANA via HDI

EXERCISE 3 –XSJS AND XSODATA SERVICES 
Objective

For this exercise we will now build the XSJS and XSODATA services used to expose our data model to the user interface. Although XS, advanced runs on node.js, SAP has added modules to node.js to provide XSJS and XSODATA emulation. Therefore you can use the same programming model and much of the same APIs from XS, classic even within this new environment. .

Exercise Description 

1. Node.js XSJS Bootstap
2. XSJS Services
3. XSJS Services which branch back into Node.js Modules
4. XSODATA Services
